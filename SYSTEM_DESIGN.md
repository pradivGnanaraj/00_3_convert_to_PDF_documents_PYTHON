# PDF Generation Script System Design

## Overview

The PDF Generation Script project is designed to transform data from a CSV file into visually appealing PDF documents. It utilizes the `fpdf` library to create PDFs with defined topics, lines, and footers. This system showcases how automation can streamline the process of generating informative and organized documents.

## Architecture

The architecture of the PDF Generation Script project consists of the following components:

1. **CSV Data Source (`topics.csv`):** This CSV file contains data about topics and their associated page counts. Each row includes a topic name and the number of pages for that topic.

2. **PDF Generation Script (`script.py`):** This Python script is the core of the system. It reads data from the `topics.csv` file and utilizes the `fpdf` library to generate PDF documents. The script follows a structured process to create PDFs with topics, lines, and footers.

3. **Generated PDFs (`output.pdf`):** The script generates PDF documents with the specified topics, lines, and footers. The output is stored in the `output.pdf` file.

## Data Flow

1. The `script.py` script reads data from the `topics.csv` file, extracting topics and page counts.
2. For each topic in the CSV, the script generates a PDF page. It adds the topic header, lines, and footer.
3. The PDF generation process creates pages based on the specified page counts for each topic.
4. The generated PDF document is saved as `output.pdf`.

## File Structure

- `script.py`
- `topics.csv`
- `output.pdf`
- `LICENSE` (License file)
- `README.md` (Project documentation)

## Interaction Flow

1. User runs the `script.py` script.
2. The script reads data from `topics.csv` and generates the PDF document.
3. The generated PDF, `output.pdf`, is saved in the project directory.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `fpdf` library (install using `pip install fpdf`)
- `topics.csv` data file

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

- Currently, the script generates basic PDF layouts with topics, lines, and footers. Future enhancements could include support for more complex layouts, such as images, tables, and headers.
- The design and style of the generated PDFs can be improved to align with specific branding or design requirements.

## Conclusion

The PDF Generation Script project demonstrates the capabilities of transforming data into professionally designed PDF documents. This system design serves as a foundation for expanding the project's features and enhancing its visual appeal.
